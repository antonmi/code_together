Simple example of collaborative coding.

Basic technologies:

1. WebSocket server based on [em-websocket](https://github.com/igrigorik/em-websocket/).
 
2. [diff-match-patch](https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/) algorithm both on clients and server side.

3. [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net) to highlight the code.

See demo here: [code_together](http://antonmi.github.io/code_together) (in development)

If happy to see this simple demo, please visit [live-study.ru](http://live-study.ru) (in russian, still in development) to see how we try to use collaborative tools for education.
